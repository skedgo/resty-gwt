The [RestyGWT Team](http://restygwt.fusesource.org) is pleased to announce
the release of RestyGWT 1.3. RestyGWT is a
[GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) generator for REST services and a
Jackson style object to JSON encoder/decoder. It makes accessing REST based
JSON services as easy to access as GWT RPC style services.

Release Highlights:

* Added additional tests to ensure ObjectEncoderDecoder is not left out again
* fix  Issue #84: allow null values in collections of pojo and primitives
* XSRFTokenCallbackFilter didn't set the XSRF token correctly in IE9
* allow jsonignore to omit fields for de/serialization - issue #30
* added test for arrays de/encoding
* added support for one-dimensional arrays
* go through ALL callbacks even in case of error

* obey failed status codes as without cache.
* use getter/setter for token to allow subclassing
* allow null values for primitives and fill use the default values in such cases
* remove yellow flags in eclipse, i.e. cleanup imports, deprectated method, suppress warnings

* Add support for numbers and booleans to be decoded to strings
* Removed restriction on @Attribute for sub resource locators
* Allow null to @QueryParam arguments
* pass on headers and query when resolving the path on a Resource
* Make ObjectEncoderDecoder an AbstractEncoderDecoder
* Revert "Merge branch 'casting'"
* Merge branch 'casting'
* added JsonIgnore annotation; rearranged the Object encoder/decoder to be properly registered
* slight change to accommodate situations where casting signature differs
* Added support for casting of RestService interfaces.
